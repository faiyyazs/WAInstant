# containing your custom domain (example.io) if you want a custom domain.

# Notes:
# - For a docs/ folder, change `path: docs` above and push your files there.
# - If you include a CNAME file at repo root with your custom domain, GitHub will pick it up.
# - After the workflow runs successfully the site will be published; check Settings → Pages to
#   confirm and enable "Enforce HTTPS" if needed.
